Viterbi for Computing Best Tagging Sequences Based on a Trigram HMM

##File Structure:
./data/  contains the sample input data, sample HMM model, sample output

viterbi.py  reads in the HMM model,reads in the inpupt data with sentences and output best tagging sequences with log-probs

state.py  a class of State used by viterbi.py
